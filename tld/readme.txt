The tld.csv file is originally from IANA: https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db 
Though since IANA does not provide the list as csv, the following list is used which uses the IANA list as source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gh0stwizard/iana-tld-extractor/master/tld.csv
Some TLD's have been added by hand, in order to decrease the amount of errors that could come up during a rootreport.
